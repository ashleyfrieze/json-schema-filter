# Json Schema Filter

Applies a schema to some JSON in order to remove extraneous fields and add defaults.

This is based on the use of [JSON Schema v7](https://json-schema.org/draft-07/json-schema-release-notes.html).

## Example code only

This code demonstrates the following concepts:

- How to use v7 schemas with defaults to populate missing data
- How to pre-process an input object to remove fields that are not in the schema

*It is not a complete solution*
